# Concepts

- **Loops Invariant:** Is a property of a program loop that is true before (and after) each iteration.
- **Analysis:** Predict the resources the algorithm will need.
- **Runtime:** It is the number of primitive operations or "steps" performed.
- **Growth Rate:** Or order of growth, it's the runtime that's really relevant.
